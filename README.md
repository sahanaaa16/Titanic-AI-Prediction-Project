# Titanic-AI-Prediction-Project
Within the Collaborate AI Club in my college, I worked on creating an effective AI predicting model using differing methods of sorting data within python and pandas. Attached is each differing method with its various accuracies.

Here's what I did in each of the weeks:

Week 2: "traditional" train_test_split with limited features
Week 3: more features, but still no string features; using train_test_split alongside one_hot_encoding
Week 4: converting string features to numerical values and using test_train_split alongside forest tree patterns - highest accuracy yet
